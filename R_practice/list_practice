#Here are some codes for basic R list variables
#list variable in R can contain multiple components of different type. Each component can be an integer, a vector, a matrix, a dataframe,
#or even other lists

#creating a list by the function list():
# Vector with numerics from 1 up to 10
my_vector <- 1:10 
# Matrix with numerics from 1 up to 9
my_matrix <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)
# First 10 elements of the built-in data frame 'mtcars'
my_df <- mtcars[1:10,]
# Construct list with these different elements:
my_list <- list(my_vector, my_matrix, my_df)

#name your components in a list:
names(my_list) <- c("vec", "mat", "df")

#shining_list is a list contains of the "moviename": "Shining", "actors"(a vector of 5 actors' names), and "reviews" (a matrix contains
#3 lines of reviews from different reviewers.
# select the last actor
last_actor <- shining_list[["actors"]][5]
# select the second review, note that in matrix selecting, we always need to indicate both the column and row we are interested in.
second_review <- shining_list[["reviews"]][2,]

#add a component to the end of some list with itself named:
shining_list_full <- c(shining_list, "year" = 1980)

#factor variable: can take discrete "values", similar to python vector
#generate a factor variable:
gender_vector <- ("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")

#convert a vector to a factor variable
factor_gender_vector <- factor(gender_vector)

#change names of each level in a factor:
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
#note that defaultly R will rank levels alphabetically, therefore in this factor, the first level will be "F" instead "M".
#so we need to first assign "Female", then "Male"
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")

#check a variable
summary(factor_survey_vector)
#output results:
#Female   Male 
#     2      3 

#assign ordered levels to factor
speed_vector <- c("Fast", "Slow", "Slow", "Fast", "Ultra-fast")
factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector, ordered=TRUE, levels = c("Slow","Fast","Ultra-fast"))
#if print factor_speed_vector, the order of levels will be: Slow<Fast<Ultra-fast

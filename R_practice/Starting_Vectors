#create a vector:

#sum of vectors
A_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)

#print something
total_vector

#sum of vector elements:
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)

#compare two values and store the result in variable "answer"
answer <- total_poker > total_roulette

#select some element in the vector:
poker_wednesday <- poker_vector[3]
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(2,3,4)]
#or
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(2:4)]
#with name assigned: (note here we cannot write c("Monday":"Wednesday"))
average_midweek_gain <- mean(poker_vector[c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday")])

#comparing multiple values with one value:
selection_vector <- poker_vector>0
#or
c(5,4,2,1) > 3
#R will automatically form 3 into c(3,3,3,3) and do vector comparison
#output result could be: TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE

#selecting elements by some comparison results:
poker_winning_days <- poker_vector[selection_vector]
#this will only select elements from poker_vector where the selection_vector is TRUE (default setting by R)

#suppose mtcars is a dataframe that contains information about different car prototypes
#dataframe is consist of columns as data types and rows as observation values
#to check the first observations and last observations:
head(mtcars)
tail(mtcars)

#check the dataframe structures: (this will display how many objectives and variables in the dataframe as well as their detailed values
str(mtcars)

#create a new data frame: (vectors should be the same length, but can be with different variable type)

type <- c("Terrestrial planet", "Terrestrial planet", "Terrestrial planet", "Terrestrial planet", "Gas giant", "Gas giant", "Gas giant", "Gas giant")
diameter <- c(0.382, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.209, 9.449, 4.007, 3.883);

# Create the data frame:
